## How Can I Contribute?

You can see details on how to contribute in [HTC - OI Wiki](https://oi-wiki.org/intro/htc/).

Also, please read guidelines on format in the [Format Guide](https://oi-wiki.org/intro/format/).

## What do I Need to Follow?

If you find someone not following the guidelines here, feel free to contribute yourself or contact [hi@oi-wiki.org](mailto:hi@oi-wiki.org).

+ We welcome you to review other pull requests, but please comment in a friendly way. Such comments that cast negative reviews will deeply hurt the community contributors' feelings, and therefore is not recommended to do so. When you find a problem in a pull request, a further pull request is welcome, but it is not welcome to speak negatively of the contributors (pull request authors), while you have no constructiveness in this pull request.

+ Please read carefully before commenting on an issue or a pull request.

+ It is recommended to keep track with your pull request. Please don't open a pull request, and stop keeping track. It will keep the OI Wiki editors and maintainers busy.

+ Remember that you are in a community, and you need to accept others to contribute, along with their contributed content, whether it is with quality or not, maybe even collaborate. If you cannot agree with this concept, feel free to fork this repository and make your changes by your own. On the other hand, your ideas might not be as good as others, so listen to other.

+ Please do not disturb the editors unless you have something changed or important for the OI Wiki community.

By contributing to the community, you agree that the OI Wiki organization can block users who violate the community guidelines and damage the harmony of the community.
